( https://data.boston.gov/organization/boston-maps). The data contains Neighborhood boundaries data layer with combination of zoning neighborhood boundaries, zip code boundaries and 2010 Census tract boundaries. I used this data to create a map with neighborhood superimposed on top. \n\nI used Forsquare API to get the most common venues of given Neighborhood of Boston. I mostly used Geopy package to scape the coordinates for each neighborhood. \n\nI used the acres data from the Analyze Boston dataset to create a choreomap with color scale representing the size of the neighborhood.",
